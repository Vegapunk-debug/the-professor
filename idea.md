Idea: The Professor (AI-Driven Document Intelligence & Learning Platform)

1. Project Overview
The Professor is a full-stack AI application that transforms static PDF documents into interactive, conversational learning environments. It utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide deep document analysis, secure user workspaces, and automated educational assessments.

2. Problem Statement
Self-directed learning from dense academic or technical PDFs is often inefficient. Learners lack a way to instantly verify their understanding or query specific sections without manual searching. Furthermore, there is a lack of centralized platforms that combine document storage with personalized AI tutoring.

3. Key Features
Neural PDF Extraction: High-fidelity text extraction from multi-page documents using specialized backend services.

Contextual AI Chat: Real-time dialogue using the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, grounded specifically in the uploaded document's context.

Automated Quiz Generation: An intelligent feature that analyzes document segments to generate Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and flashcards for self-assessment.

Secure Authentication: A robust user system (JWT-based) allowing learners to save their documents and chat history securely.

3D Interactive Interface: A high-end frontend experience using React Three Fiber to visualize the AI’s "Neural State" during processing.

4. Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Three.js.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript.

Database: MongoDB (User data, Document metadata, saved Quizzes).

AI & Processing: Google Gemini API, Multer (file handling), PDF-Parse.

5. Software Engineering & System Design (SESD Project Focus)
OOP Principles: Utilization of Interfaces for AI providers and Inheritance for document processors to ensure a clean, extensible codebase.

MVC Architecture: Strict separation between Routes, Controllers, and Services.

Middleware Design: Implementation of custom Auth-Guard middleware to protect private routes and handle file validation.

Scalability: Decoupled service layers to allow for future integration of different LLMs or file types (e.g., .docx, .txt).
